# aws-account-alias [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/securityscorecard/aws-account-alias.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/securityscorecard/aws-account-alias)

## Motivation

You need the AWS account alias for the credentials found by the SDK's default
credential provider, and you don't want to/can't install the AWS CLI.

## Our Motivation

The AWS authentication backend in [Hashicorp Vault](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault)
requires the roles to be uniquely named. If you have multiple AWS accounts you wish
to authenticate against identical roles, you have two options:

1. Mount the AWS authentication backend multiple times, and duplicate the roles with
changed AWS account IDs. This requires having a way to detect which account you're
running in, and changing the API endpoint you use based off that.
2. Mount the AWS authentication backend once, follow the [cross account access](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/aws.html#cross-account-access)
guide, and prefix the Vault roles with a string depending on the account. This tool
facilitates that.
